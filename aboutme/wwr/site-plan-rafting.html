    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to provide a fun and memorable fishing experience for families, creating an opportunity for grandparents, parents, and children to connect and spend quality time together in nature. We aim to foster an environment where families can bond over shared adventures and create lasting memories, all while enjoying the excitement of fishing.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience consists of families of all ages, with a particular focus on multigenerational groupsâ€”grandparents, parents, and children looking for enjoyable outdoor activities. These families are typically middle-class, seeking affordable and meaningful ways to spend time together. Many may have a passion for outdoor activities, nature, or adventure, but might lack the time or knowledge to organize their own fishing trips. What they want is a safe, family-friendly environment where everyone, regardless of age or experience, can participate. They are looking for an opportunity to relax and connect with their loved ones while experiencing the thrill of fishing. Many in this group want to introduce their children to new outdoor activities but may not have the expertise to do it themselves. Their needs that aren't being met include access to well-organized, fun, and stress-free fishing experiences that cater to multiple generations. Many available fishing trips are either too specialized or not geared towards families with younger children or elderly members. We aim to fill this gap by offering easy-to-access, family-centered fishing activities. Our audience will primarily access the site via mobile devices, with many also using laptops and desktops for planning purposes. We will ensure the site is fully responsive and easy to navigate on all platforms, with quick access to booking options and clear information about our services.</p>
