    <p>Hi, my name is Jean Francois Ango. I am currently pursuing a degree in Nursing and I aspire to become an IT Nurse. I love working with technology and exploring new ways to build websites.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing soccer. I am excited to learn more about web design through this course, as I believe it will be beneficial for my future career as a Nurse.</p>
